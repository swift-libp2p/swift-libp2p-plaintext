## Overview
⚠️ Plaintext is intended only for debugging and interoperability testing purposes. ⚠️

> Secure communications are a key feature of libp2p, and encrypted transport is configured by default in libp2p implementations to encourage security for all production traffic. However, there are some use cases such as testing in which encryption is unnecessary. For such cases, the plaintext "security" protocol can be used. By conforming to the same interface as real security adapters like SECIO and TLS, the plaintext module can be used as a drop-in replacement when encryption is not needed.
